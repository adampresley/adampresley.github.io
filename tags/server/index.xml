      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a week ago I moved all the code for my site onto a new VPS
(Virtual Private Server) provided by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.2host.com&#34;&gt;2Host.com&lt;/a&gt;.
With their unmanaged service I get 1GB of RAM, 30GB of hard drive space,
and over 9TB of bandwidth, and I get it at a great price! So far the
service has been very stable, with only a few issues with the newest
Ubuntu VM images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that setting up your own Linux VPS is not for the faint of heart,
and should only be attempted by the more nerdy. :) Anyway, I got Apache
2 and PHP 5 setup, along with MySQL 5, Tomcat 6, and Railo running my
Coldfusion applications. I must say that it is &lt;em&gt;FAST&lt;/em&gt;, and I am most
pleased with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did run into initial setup issue when I tried using the Ubuntu 9.10
image. MySQL would install, but put no default &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; user for me to
administer with. The fix ended up being me going back to Ubuntu 8.04,
and those problems seemed to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this has been a good experience, and I hope it continues to be
so! Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
