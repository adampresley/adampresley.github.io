      <title>HR 3523 - Letter Regarding CISPA</title>
      <link>http://adampresley.com/post/hr-3523-letter-regarding-cispa/</link>

      <guid>http://adampresley.com/post/hr-3523-letter-regarding-cispa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent proposed CISPA bill, HR 3523, I have written my
House Representative Ralph Hall the following letter. I encourage you to
do the same if you feel that this bill would be potentially detrimental
to online privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Hall,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing you in regards to the proposed bill HR 3523, better known
as CISPA, or the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. Having
reviewed the wording of the proposed bill myself, as well as the
abundant media coverage and analysis from dozens of other sources I
write to express my concern over what I consider to be a dangerously
broad and unspecific proposal of power to our federal government and
the corporate private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional in the computer software industry I am well aware
of the issues surrounding cyber security and understand how difficult
it is to track, rectify and prevent criminal cyber attacks in software
and network systems. As an &amp;ldquo;average Joe&amp;rdquo; I have had my personal web
site attacked by foreign persons, family members who have lost money
from identity theft, and gone through the pain of trying to &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo;
software from perceived threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not, however, feel that such broad powers given by language as
vague as &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;theft or misappropriation of private or government
information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable
information&amp;rdquo; is the answer in a world greedy, patent
portfolio-strengthening corporations, ever concerned about copyright
infringement affecting the bottom line. I feel this type of response
to cyber security issues is far too knee-jerk, and requires a great
deal of analysis and consensus from more than just large corporate
entities with an interest in protecting IP. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about some of
the companies backing this bill, i.e. AT&amp;amp;T, Microsoft, Dell, Facebook,
Verizon, Oracle, all of which recently have been involved in IP,
copyright, or patent lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge you and all members of the House to abandon this bill and
instead find security experts who do not have a dollar attached to
some IP lawsuit, but have the privacy and rights of the average
netizen in mind. Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Adam Presley
Concerned citizen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Dallas TechFest 2010</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at Dallas
TechFest 2010. I presented on taking an existing ColdFusion application
and spicing it up incrementally using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jquery.com&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, the hottest JavaScript
library around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The micro-conference; I suppose you can call it that, was a lot of fun.
I attended some pretty good sessions, including MySQL optimization,
Event Gateway programming in ColdFusion, and an introduction to Grails
and CouchDB. I must say that CouchDB is &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; interesting,
and may find its way into one of my projects in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running on a VPS Now</title>
      <link>http://adampresley.com/post/running-on-a-vps-now/</link>

      <guid>http://adampresley.com/post/running-on-a-vps-now/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a week ago I moved all the code for my site onto a new VPS
(Virtual Private Server) provided by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.2host.com&#34;&gt;2Host.com&lt;/a&gt;.
With their unmanaged service I get 1GB of RAM, 30GB of hard drive space,
and over 9TB of bandwidth, and I get it at a great price! So far the
service has been very stable, with only a few issues with the newest
Ubuntu VM images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that setting up your own Linux VPS is not for the faint of heart,
and should only be attempted by the more nerdy. :) Anyway, I got Apache
2 and PHP 5 setup, along with MySQL 5, Tomcat 6, and Railo running my
Coldfusion applications. I must say that it is &lt;em&gt;FAST&lt;/em&gt;, and I am most
pleased with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did run into initial setup issue when I tried using the Ubuntu 9.10
image. MySQL would install, but put no default &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; user for me to
administer with. The fix ended up being me going back to Ubuntu 8.04,
and those problems seemed to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this has been a good experience, and I hope it continues to be
so! Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Linux and Windows Screen Sharing Software</title>
      <link>http://adampresley.com/post/free-linux-and-windows-screen-sharing-software/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for cool applications. I also am a super-sucker for
&lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; cool applications. I was working on some code with my friend
Collin tonight and we had a need to take a look at some code together,
but we aren&amp;rsquo;t anywhere near each other. To further complicate matters
I&amp;rsquo;m running on Ubuntu Linux and he on Windows. After a quick search I
came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yuuguu.com/home&#34;&gt;Yuuguu Instant Screen Sharing&lt;/a&gt;. What a neat program!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple download of a Debian package, and moments later I get a sign-up
screen. That too was painless, and before I knew it, I simply entered my
MSN account information, I selected Collin from the list, and clicked
Share. Kaboom!!! Awesomeness exploded onto my screen, and we were
sharing desktops before I knew it! Go give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dallas Techfest and ColdFusion 9</title>
      <link>http://adampresley.com/post/dallas-techfest-and-coldfusion-9/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2009 08:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://adampresley.com/post/dallas-techfest-and-coldfusion-9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This last Friday I attended the ColdFusion track at the Dallas Techfest.
I went with a coworker and ex-coworker specifically to see the
ColdFusion 9 preview. It was a good presentation that I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m a
little excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the most exciting ColdFusion release in a long time. In
my eyes ColdFusion, with the version 9 release, is well on its way to
becoming a programmer&amp;rsquo;s language. Allow me to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a programming background in C/C++. In fact you
could call C++ my first love of sorts. When I got into web-based
development my first exposure was in ASP classic, and although I
consider it clunky, it was programming to me. PHP was my next web
scripting langauge, and is to this day my favorite web-based language to
work with. I develop with ColdFusion for a living, however, and have
always maintained a love/hate relationship to it with all of the
tag-based commands and such. Yet this tag-based concept is a strong
selling point for most CF developers&amp;hellip; something I never really
understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ColdFusion 9 sets out to bridge the gap between the scripters and the
taggers. Finally. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the fact that CF 9 will finally have
full language support in CFSCRIPT. About time! Yes, you can now create
components, throw exceptions, and do queries in CFSCRIPT without writing
hand-spun custom function wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next exciting feature for me is that components are getting more OOP
goodness. Actual constructors for initializing components, as well as a
supposed &amp;ldquo;strict&amp;rdquo; mode on CFCs to force CF to compile them as POJOs
(Plain Old Java Objects). I can only see this as a performance benefit,
as the current cost of calling a method on a CFC involves instantiating
a compiled Java class&amp;hellip; for EACH method!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable features includes a true ternary expression, new language
support for the Hibernate ORM library, and more. Looks like a good
release!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, and happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;
