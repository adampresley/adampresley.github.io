      <title>A Good Resource on Web App Performance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I came across an online, public domain license book by Stoyan
Stefanov called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bookofspeed.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Book of Speed&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is incomplete the
information found in this book is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book the author talks about many of the intricate details of web
page optimization, such as minification, combining resources, sprites,
and more. He also dives further down into the specifics of the TCP/IP
protocol and how that affects you as a web application developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really look forward to seeing this awesome resource continue to grow
and highly recommend anyone who builds web applications and sites for a
living give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Less Than Pleasant Experience on the Kemah Boardwalk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This blog entry isn&amp;rsquo;t technical like most of my blog
entries, but instead is a rant about a negative experience had at a show
at an amusement park and a restaurant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last weekend (2012-09-12) Maryanne and I took the kids to the Kemah
Boardwalk for a day of fun and school extra credit. The Kemah Boardwalk
is located in Kemah, TX not far from our home in Friendswood, TX. The
boardwalk is a pretty cool little spot on the bay with shops,
midway-style games, rides and restaurants. There is quite a bit to do
there and can be a good day&amp;rsquo;s getaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular day Kemah was hosting the 11th annual Tuba Christmas,
and Taylor&amp;rsquo;s teacher was playing along with them. Because of this the
band teachers encourage the students to come to the show, and even
sweetened the deal with extra credit. The show was fun with a whole
bunch of tubas playing your Christmas favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Tuba Christmas show we browsed around at a few shops for a
little while to waste a bit of time before another show starting at
6:30pm, the Boat Lane Parade. We had never seen this show and thought it
would be cool to see a bunch of boats in the bay lit up with the
Christmas spirit. At first we thought about eating before the show, but
with only an hour remaining before the show was scheduled to start we
instead decided to stake out a spot by the rail so we could have a nice
view of the boats coming in and out during the show. The time is
5:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a space fairly close to the rail, and just outside of a
roped-off section next to Landry&amp;rsquo;s Seafood. The roped-off section had
tables for Landry&amp;rsquo;s outside seating with enough space for servers to
take care of their guests. During the course of the next hour Landry&amp;rsquo;s
had issues with people standing directly in front of the rope, and in
some cases behind the roped off area. They kept asking people to move to
the sides of the rope and some complied, others did not. We were on the
correct side of the rope; right up against it in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 6:20 (give or take a few minutes) some manager from Landry&amp;rsquo;s
came out with a crew and started to undo the ropes, then informed
everyone that we would all have to move over, and that they were
extending the roped-off area so diners inside the restaurant could see
the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit that I am a bit pissy about this. Make no mistake that I am not
arguing the right for Landry&amp;rsquo;s Seafood to do this, as the Landry&amp;rsquo;s
company owns the restaurant AND the entire Kemah Boardwalk. At this
point I am arguing that expanding the roped-off area just minutes before
the show start is what one might call a &amp;ldquo;douche-bag move&amp;rdquo;. We were not
breaking the rules, we were outside the roped-off zone, and had waited
for almost an hour there, patiently. We had our name on the list to eat
at Landry&amp;rsquo;s at one point, but the wait was taking too long, and we
didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the show, so we took it off and waited on the dock
instead. Why then should we be punished and forced to move when we opted
to wait in a spot where we could see? Why should those who did not stake
out a spot to see, but chose to eat instead, get preferential
treatment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we ended up leaving, as the entire boardwalk on that side was
completely full even before the change in the rope zone. We missed the
show which is unfortunate. Many people opted to leave and were upset,
and I for one do not understand why a restaurant would choose to
alienate potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Review: Brio Tuscan Grille&#39;</title>

Tonight Maryanne and I went to a lovely restaurant that just opened here
in Allen called &lt;strong&gt;Brio Tuscan Grille&lt;/strong&gt;. We were greeted by very nice
valet parking attendants who even opened the door for us. Nice. A good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was a nice, low light Tuscany style, large dining room
with plenty of room for small and large parties alike. From greeting to
seating every one of the staff was nicely attired and very friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of minutes our waiter introduced himself and presented
us with the current specials and wine selections. Much to my delight not
only was he very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, anytime the
waiter was unable to come by another of the wait staff came by instead
to make sure we were taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://s3.amazonaws.com/www.adampresley.com/posts/brio-room-150x150.jpg&#34; class=&#34;pull-right&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was very tasty, and presentation was top
notch. Price vs. portion was not too bad for my entree, which was the
Roasted Lamb. Maryanne&amp;rsquo;s dish, some type of seafood pasta, which was
also tasty, was only a little pricey for the portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then decided to give the dessert a try. We had a wonderful,
melt-in-your-mouth brownie with ice cream dessert that was worth every
penny. Couple that with a good, mild coffee with cream and our dinner
was given a nice finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed my experience at Brio, and look forward to returning there to
dine. For more information about this restaurant visit their website at
