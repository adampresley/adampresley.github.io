Ok, that was just plain odd. I'm working on our Jedi Academy server,
messing with administration permissions and such, and I setup a
temporary password to get in the server for while I'm working on it.
This is to prevent people from getting in because I was starting and
stopping the server every time I tested a change. When I went back and
commented out the password command variable it wouldn't go away! I tried
everything I could think of!! What did I have to do? Had to set the
password variable to blank, and it suddenly worked. <_< GAH!
