Last night I did it. I took the plunge. I formatted and installed 64-bit
Windows 7 Release Candadite. The experience, thus far, has been fairly
painless. The installer was the simpliest installer for Windows I've
used to date (and the prettiest).

Once in Windows I began the search for drivers to make everything work.
Windows 7 automatically showed me a driver download from nVidia for my
geForce 275 GTX, but I opted to visit the [eVGA](http://www.evga.com/Default.asp) site instead, and
sure enough they have a Windows 7 driver.

From here I payed a visit to the Creative Labs site for my sound device.
Again I was fortunate to discover that my Sound Blaster X-Fi Gamer card
has beta Windows 7 driver support. After a reboot everything played nice
and clear.

Very quickly I proceeded to download Firefox so that I didn't have to
use IE anymore. I must note here that I do wish that Firefox had a
64-bit version to take full advantage of my hardware and newest OS, but
I can live with the smaller 32-bits. :)

All while doing these tasks I also began the LONG update of Lord of the
Rings Online: Mines of Moria. The game install is big enough, but the
update currently sits at 4,000 plus files. That took a few hours to
finish.

Now I am in the process of restoring backups from my [Mozy Home](https://mozy.com/)
account to get back my email, code, and documents.
