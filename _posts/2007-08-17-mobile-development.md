Several months ago I purchased a new cell phone because I decided to
join the cool people and jump on the media/internet/do it all phone
bandwagon. With this in mind I purchased the Helio Ocean. Almost
$300 cheaper than the iPhone this puppy has most of the best features
found on a cell phone to date, with a service plan that is fairly
priced.  

Of course the developer in me saw that this phone uses Java technology
for its applications. Hey, I know Java! I should write an application.
The problem was that I had no real application need at the time so I
shrugged it off.  

Until now. Just two weeks ago I joined the Weight Watchers program
in an attempt to lose weight. In case you aren't aware, Weight Watchers
uses a point system which is based off calorie, fat, and fiber content.
Perfect! I need a little application on my phone to enter in calories,
fat, and fiber and it spit out the points count.  
  
Turns out that the mobile development part wasn't so difficult. The hard
part is getting your Java application **TO** your Helio and getting it to
**EXECUTE**. The folks at Helio apparently do not wish third party
people developing applications without their blessing so they require
you to purchase a developer license from them. No thanks.  
  
A little looking around on the internet turns up a few peeps who have
figured out that Helio simply renames their JAR files, and adds two
signatures to it. This coupled with a descriptor file allows you to
download your custom application to your Helio device and execute it. So
as a result I have made my first draft of the Weight Watchers points
calculator application. It is VERY rough right now, and needs a bit of
work. It is also not 100% accurate in the calculation, but it is pretty
close, so it will work as a means to calculate points in a hurry or on
the go. Meanwhile I will continue spicing the app up and once done will
post on my website for consumption by not only Helio users, but also
anyone who has a Java enabled phone.
