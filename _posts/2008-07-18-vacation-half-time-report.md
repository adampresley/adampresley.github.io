So this is Wednesday night and my vacation week is half over. Here is
the half-time report of what has transpired thus far. Monday we arrived
a little after noon and headed down to "The Spot" for some grub. We
dined up on the top deck overlooking the gulf, the breeze nice and and
cool, making the afternoon a nice, not too hot experience. This turned
out to be a good deal as we went down to the beach for a little bit.
Aaliyah was a bit nervous about the water, being big and scary, and...
well... big... but she warmed up pretty quick. Taylor even made a little
friend down on the beach to pick up sea shells with.

Tuesday we went to see the movie Ratatoullie. This proved to be quite
the cute movie with a good morale, so good for the kiddos. Overall a
well executed movie. We chilled out for a while, then went down to the
pool and did some swimming. Of course Maryanne and I had to "check out"
the poolside bar.

Today we lounged over breakfast at the lounge here at the hotel for a
bit. Afterwards we went to the NASA Kids Space Exhibit. Lots of cool
things for the kids to do and see. Oooy gooey exhibit, land the space
shuttle, and lots more!

As for food so far we've done **The Spot**, **Marios at the Seawall**,
and **Guidos**. Let me say that Guidos is simply awesome. Some really
great sea food. Marios was a disappointment. Some of the food was not as
fresh as I had hoped, and the service was lacking.
