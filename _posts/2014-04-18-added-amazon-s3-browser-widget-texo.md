After much work I have completed adding an Amazon S3 Browser widget to Texo CMS. Texo is the engine that I wrote which runs this blog. It is still in its infancy but this widget will certainly make writing my blog posts easier. After setting up Amazon S3 key settings and bucket information a new button shows up while editing or writing blog entries. Clicking on this brings up a widget that shows all available images and allows me to view them, select an image, delete, and even upload new images. Selecting an image will populate the correct Markdown syntax in the editor with the URL ready to go.
