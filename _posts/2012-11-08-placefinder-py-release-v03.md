Quick entry to point out that my Yahoo! BOSS PlaceFinder API Python
module, **placefinder-py**, has a new *0.3* release. This release
includes:  

* Added function to reverse-geocode latitude/longitude
* Changed unit tests to be able to be run by nose

So go and check out the wiki documentation to see the latest version and
what you can do with it.
