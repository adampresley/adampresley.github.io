Ok, this programming language I stumbled across has to be the nerdiest
programming language ever conceived, sober or drunk! The creators of
this language believe that humble whitespace characters have received a
bad wrap, and as such pay homage to the lowest common characters,
whitespace. For the nerdy programmer types such as myself, check it out
at <http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php>. For the rest of
you... well, you'll likely not **SEE** anything of use. :)
