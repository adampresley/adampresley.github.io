It was an interesting discussion last night with a good friend of mine.
Problems come and go in life, and our minds can often be flooded with
these issues making it difficult to thing, concentrate, and solve
problems, let alone stay sane in day to day life. A common thing taught
today to supposedly help deal with this is to find your safe place. This
is a sort of target to focus on. A place that is free from these
troubles where you can focus and deal with what you need to.

I have to ask myself if this is always best. It would seem that when one
meditates and goes to their "cave", or "tunnel", or "field", or
whatever, that they are simple going into a room, closing the door,
locking it, and letting their issues wait outside. The side effect of
this would seem to be that once you open the door they are there again
to assault you. They weren't dealt with.

I'm no doctor so I speak with no authority. Most times I prefer,
however, to turn up my music and let the problems in, and flood my mind.
And then I attack them, working at them in my mind one at a time. This
works for me quite a bit. Not all the time, mind you, cause everyone has
to escape sometimes.

And no, I'm not discussing this to answer anyone's question, or to
advise, or anything else wise or good. I'm merely speaking aloud, giving
voice to my thoughts.

In other news I had a random person in my temporary
Jedi Academy server offer to let me use his for a bit. I admit I am
skeptical. What's in it for him? He is paying for this after all, so why
let someone else use it, for free? I did set it up, however, because
very little harm can come of us using it. So I was up till 2am setting
it up. Stupid Linux and its permissions. :p
