I am loving the hell outta Guitar Hero 2. I got to play Laid to Rest -
Lamb of God, Beast and the Harlot - Avenged Sevenfold, and Hanger 18 -
Megadeth!! DUDE! So awesome.  
  
Some of the cool new features include the encore when you do well on the
next to last song, and lots of strobe lights! Also, the band will jump
and hit the last note in unison at times. Very cool!  
  
The only thing wrong is that my second guitar is broke! NOOOO!! That
does, however, give me excuse to buy the **wireless** Gibson Flying V!!!
