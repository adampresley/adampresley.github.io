Just wanted to share a small discovery I made to those out there who may
be wishing to setup their own WordPress blog site. I use [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com)
hosting (which I'd like to say is excellent, as is their customer
service) with Linux and PHP, and as you can see I use WordPress for my
blog publishing.

Just the other day I was attempting to setup yet another [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)
blog on my girlfriend's new site, [www.maryanneanello.com](http://www.maryanneanello.com), and to my
dismay found that the visual editor was not working when she would
attempt to write blog entries.

Well I discovered that because I was using the free hosting GoDaddy
offers for those with existing hosting accounts and enough hosting
credits, it was putting a banner ad at the top of the page. This
banner's Javascript was apparently messing up the TinyMCE visual editor
WordPress uess.

So here's a tip. Gonna use WordPress and want the visual editor? Gonna
use free GoDaddy hosting? Well, ya can't. Pay the \$4/month and get it
over with.
