The heat is on! (*note* actually, I'm freezing right now, our office
air is on, and it's 50 degrees outside). But I digress... The HEAT IS
ON! I have initiated a code challenge at work this week. I work for a
software company in Dallas that is in the medical field, and I serve as
the Lead Software Architect. Part of my job, aside from governing coding
standards and leading architectural design sessions, is education. Our
business is very hectic and fast because the business rules are
changing... daily. So it's pretty easy to get stuck in a rut doing the
same types of coding tasks daily.  
  
In an effort to spur a bit of creativity I have called for a code
challenge. All too frequently we as web developers are handed a task to
code, a server with TONS of RAM and hard drive space, a big-bad database
server, and told "go to town"! If that's all you know then you've never
had the pleasure of dealing with coding for embedded systems, or mobile
devices, or any other limited hardware device. So here's the challenge.  
  
I have presented our engineering team a scenario where they have a
fictional device with limited memory and disk space. The device has
ColdFusion and Apache embedded on it. No SQL database, no fancy Java
components, just CF 8 and a web server. ColdFusion is configured to run
JRUN at a maximum of 32MB of memory.  
  
The engineer must create an application that allows the user (at a
minimum) to view a list of contacts, add a contact, edit a contact, and
remove a contact. The data that is stored/tracked must contain the
contact's first name, last name, address, city, state, zip code, phone
number, and email address. All pages created must have a display space
of 240px x 400px. The final criteria: you only have 32KB of disk space
to store your application. Pages, database, components, whatever...
32KB.  
  
Code will be judged on a number of factors. Code must be clean and well
organized. It should demonstrate some type of re-usability. No, this is
not an excercise in OOP, frameworks, or any other type of design
pattern. You can use CFCs, custom tags, or good ole' functions, as long
as the code is organized and thought out. The submission demonstrating
that they meet the requirements, as well as creativity in solving the
problem wins. Yes, there is a prize, but only if you work on our
engineering team. If you don't I'm not giving you a gift card, so don't
ask. :)  
  
I have about 5 participants at this time, and hope more are interested.
I look forward to submissions! (And yes, I've done it already).  
  
Happy coding!
