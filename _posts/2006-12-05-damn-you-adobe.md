O...M...G... Today it was brought to my attention that the name for my
data manipulation language, ADAM, is already in use. By whom? None other
than Adobe!!! GAH!! Bastards!! Rotten, filthy bastards!!! Now I must
quest to find a different name. Any suggestions? Remember, data
manipulation and translation (movement) made simple.
