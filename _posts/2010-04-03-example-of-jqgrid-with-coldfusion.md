Earlier last month I blogged about [how to use jqGrid](#!post/2010/03/using-jqgrid-with-coldfusion), a grid
component written on top of jQuery, with ColdFusion. A reader of the
site asked that I put up an actual demo of this in action.   
As a result I have setup a demo page with a basic jqGrid implementation
that displays names and email addresses, and supports paging and
sorting. So without further ado here is the link to the demo page.
For more demos and examples you can also visit my Blog Code Home.   
Happy coding!
