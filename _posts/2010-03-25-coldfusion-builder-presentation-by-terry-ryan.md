If you didn't make it out to Terry Ryan's presentation on ColdFusion
Builder last night, here's what you missed.

* Free pizza and soda, provided by [Paladin Consulting](http://www.paladin-inc.com/)
* See the cool features of ColdFusion Builder
* Awesome extensions, quite possibly the most exciting feature of ColdFusion Builder
* A free license for ColdFusion Builder
* Free Microsoft XBox games
* Free t-shirts
* Free books
* Total nerd-out time
* Did I mention free stuff?

But in all seriousness, if you didn't make it, those interested in
learning more about their craft and ColdFusion, you should totally come
out to the Dallas ColdFusion User Group meetings. It's a great way to
learn more about the language you program in on a regular basis, and a
great chance to meet people and professionals in your own backyard.   
See you next time!
