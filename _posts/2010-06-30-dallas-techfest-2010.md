Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at Dallas
TechFest 2010. I presented on taking an existing ColdFusion application
and spicing it up incrementally using [jQuery](http://jquery.com), the hottest JavaScript
library around.
  
The micro-conference; I suppose you can call it that, was a lot of fun.
I attended some pretty good sessions, including MySQL optimization,
Event Gateway programming in ColdFusion, and an introduction to Grails
and CouchDB. I must say that CouchDB is *particularly* interesting,
and may find its way into one of my projects in the near future.
