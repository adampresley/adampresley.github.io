Last night was movie night. Again Maryanne and I hosted a movie night
starring the classic wacky movie, Beetlejuice. I forgot how fun that
movie is. What a blast! Katie and Tim from work made it, as well as
friends and neighbors Jeff and Andrea. We played quite a bit of Singstar
karaoke while eating a bit of greasy KFC chicken and biscuits. Mmmm.  
  
After the movie Andrea and Jeff stuck around for some Guitar Hero and
more karaoke. Pictures? Only a few, as we kinda just forgot to take
more, sadly. But hey, karaoke, alcohol, and Beetlejuice? Good times.  
  
**Notice:** Pictures are no longer present.
