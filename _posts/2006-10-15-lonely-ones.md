We are the Lonely Ones
Alone with one heart
Moving forward, carrying on
Even though we fall apart

Deep seeded hurt inside
Yet our mettle undeniable
Never quite complete
Yet a friend so reliable

A people not so rare
Always at your side
You rely on us for comfort
For the changing of the tide

Yet this is all it is
For further we cannot go
To live deeper in your life
Just cannot be so

So a friend we remain
To keep at your side
In the shadow of meaning
Forever destined to hide.

Something more?
A romance made?
Never last
Doomed to fade

For shadows of people
This we be
The unknown lovers
You cannot see.
