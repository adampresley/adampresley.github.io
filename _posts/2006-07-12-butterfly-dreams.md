Flowers open bright and bold  
Dreams and visions flicker, fade  
Kiss me now venom sweet  
And call me bitter, sour, old  
  
Alone with the wind  
Thoughts to scatter across the city  
A million faces concealed from view  
How far can a tree bend?  
  
Like coffee without cream  
Black like darkness without hope for light  
A glimmer of peace from ages past  
A dream of a dream  
  
Reaching high for her hand  
Perched upon that pedestal  
Precariously sketched on pages in my mind  
Take me now to distant land  
  
So the butterfly dreams  
To fly so far away  
Will it find home here  
Among the bitter things?
