Last night the I participated as a representative for computer programming at the Clear Creek ISD College and Career Fair night. The Clear Creek school district offers a number of programs that encourage students to jump start their future education and careers. The job fair is a way for students to talk to actual practitioners in their field of interest, or even learn about opportunities they may have never known about.

Last night was quite a success in my book. There were almost 100 tables representing business & marketing, agriculture, science and technology, education, transportation, and health services. Many tables had flashy backdrops, table covers, literature and demonstrations. I didn't quite have the flash, but I did have a small presentation running on a loop on my giant gaming laptop, which can be found [here](http://careerday2014.adampresley.com/). 

I was originally concerned I would not have many visitors. Programming isn't considered to be *exciting* by a lot of people I know. That concern was unfounded. I had a busy night! Lots of kids came by asking a wide array of questions, from "how much money will I make" to the student who is already teaching themselves or in Computer Science Pre-AP classes. I was very impressed with some students and their drive to learn on their own, asking great questions for advice on ways to learn even more.

I had a great time, and look forward to doing another if the opportunity arises. And maybe next time I'll make some flashy booth backdrops!
