As a loveable classic of my childhood, I approached the movie "Horton
Hears A Who" with caution. It is not uncommon for Hollywood to screw up
movie renditions of things that I cherish. Ok, so maybe cherish is a
strong, girlie word... How about awesome and cool. A stretch, but I
digress...  

AnyWHO... To be brief I have to say I walked away from this movie
feeling good, having a nice refreshing laugh. The animation is quite
good, with the Who's being animated true to the original representations
found in the books crafted by the good Dr. himself. Jim Carey is good,
though a little over the top, but overall portrays a decent Horton.  
  
Very enjoyable.
