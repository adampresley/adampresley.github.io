For those that know me it comes as no surprise to learn I grew up in a
hick town in north-east Texas. And in that area I have certainly seen my
share of interesting hick-culture. I had not, however, seen anything
quite like a Big Lots, which I just had the pleasure of going to tonight.  

Why was I there? Well, my girlfriend had apparently purchased some items
there, and wished to return them, so I'm along for the ride. My first
observation upon arriving is that the parking lot at this store is a
mess. Holes everywhere. The parking lots of the neighboring stores where
fine, but this one was jacked up.  
  
Then we go inside. Wow. What a white-trash mess. Oh sure, there's signs
that indicate that organization was though about, but it is certainly an
afterthought. I think what struck me the most was how some items were
just mixed in with the most unlikely shelf-fellows.  
  
Want a toaster? Just look next to the car stereos. Need a good watch?
There's tables full of them right next to the seasonal Christmas items.
And guess what was between a mini pull wagon and lawn furniture. A
chainsaw.  
  
Now that is class.
