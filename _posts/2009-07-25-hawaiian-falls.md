Dear Maryanne, Taylor, and Aaliyah,  

I just wanted to write and say that I had a really great time at
Hawaiian Falls today. We swam in the pool, got wet by the giant bucket
of water, and went down several big slides with fast water tubes. I know
we ran out of sun screen a little too early, and Aaliyah, you got sick
for some reason after lunch, but you felt better afterwards, so it
turned out ok.  
  
I hope that we get to go again to Hawaiian falls again soon together.  
  
Love,    
Daddy
