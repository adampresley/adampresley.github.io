As most of you know I tend to follow the various businesses in the
Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex that use ColdFusion as their development
platform. I came across this article the other day about one such
business in the area that is not faring well with customer opinion.
Hopefully this business can turn things around for the better and
continue to contribute to area business.
