Ladies and gentlemen! I have my copy of [Super Smash Brothers Brawl](http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html),
and it is a blast! I got to play a fair bit today, and had a really
great time. I then hooked up online with Maryanne and I on our Wii, and
my brother and his wife on theirs for a little four player online
destruction! My favorite characters so far are Link and Marth. All said,
this game is a lot of fun!! Play it!
