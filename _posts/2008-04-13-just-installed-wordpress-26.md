So I finally installed WordPress 2.6, though 2.6.1 is already in BETA 2.
I admit I am usually behind the curve on upgrading. However, there are a
couple of exciting updates that come with 2.6.

* Post Revision - Wiki like tracking of edits while you are creating a
  post, complete with revision compare
* Presss This! - A link you can add to your favorites toolbar that
  pops up a window to blog against whatever website you are currently
  on, allowing you to easily link, get photos, videos, and more.
* Theme Preview - Actually try on a theme before applying it. Finally!
* Bulk plugin management

And that's just a few. There are a good number more at

here is the video demonstrating some of the new stuff!
