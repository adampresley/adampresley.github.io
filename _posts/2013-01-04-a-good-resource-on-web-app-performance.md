Last night I came across an online, public domain license book by Stoyan
Stefanov called [Book of Speed](http://www.bookofspeed.com/index.html). Although it is incomplete the
information found in this book is **very** good.  
  
In this book the author talks about many of the intricate details of web
page optimization, such as minification, combining resources, sprites,
and more. He also dives further down into the specifics of the TCP/IP
protocol and how that affects you as a web application developer.   
  
I really look forward to seeing this awesome resource continue to grow
and highly recommend anyone who builds web applications and sites for a
living give it a read.  
  
Happy coding!
