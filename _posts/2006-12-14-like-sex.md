Comments. They are a drug. They are like sex. We post blog entries for
various reasons. Oftentimes blogging is a means to release the inner
thoughts that would normally be trapped behind the sociological barriers
of fear prohibiting us to actually speak words to another human being.
Either that, or we simply lack the eloquence to put into audible
verbiage that which we most need to say. In other cases it is a slight
case of exhibitionism. I personally feel that all cases are true to one
degree of another in everyone who claims address in the blogosphere.

As I say in the title, like sex. Comments are like sex. Knowing that
someone, or more than one person, is reading what you have to say, feels
the need to comment, and keeps coming back to read more offers up a
sense of importance. Or at least you feel good that someone bothers and
cares about what you have to say. It can also offer a sort of euphoric
outlet. Something similar to knowing that someone is watching you
perform a sex act, knowing that people that you **may** or **may not**
know are interested and reading about your personal life can be
invigorating. Interesting, huh?

So, next time you are blogging, you'll think about sex, or the next time
you have sex, you may wanna blog about it!
