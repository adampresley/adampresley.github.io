Join me tomorrow night at the Dallas/Ft. Worth ColdFusion User Group
meeting where Dave Shuck will be presenting a beginner's introduction to
ColdSpring and dependency injection, following by yours truly presenting
Chapter 7 of the **Head First Design Patterns** book: Adapter and
Facade patterns. There is usually food, nerds, and a chance to network
and learn with the best ColdFusion peeps in Dallas!
