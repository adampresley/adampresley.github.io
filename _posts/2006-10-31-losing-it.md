Ahhh. I seem on the verge of insanity lately. Every little thing has me
jittery. Every little hiccup a punch in the gut. Money has been terribly
tight, and it doesn't help that I'm a poor money manager on top of that.
Work has been nuts. It's that time of the year again where we scramble
to get every sale possible, so naturally the Professional Services
department will be busy. I then have a task of doing a **massive**
update to our software on over 700 files, and so little time to do it. I
have guests coming down in just over a week, and I'm stressing that
while I'm at it.

I'm telling you, I'll have grey hairs before this year is over.
