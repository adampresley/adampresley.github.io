Just wanted to post up a couple of pictures of what Maryanne and the
girls worked on today. We had gone to [Hobby Lobby](http://hobbylobby.com/) to find some
craft-ie kind of stuff for the kids to do, and came across a neat
ceramic paint set. It contains three ceramic pigs, going from small to
large, and five or six paint colors. It's neat because it just gives you
the pigs, paint, brushes, and lets you be as creative as you wish to
be!
