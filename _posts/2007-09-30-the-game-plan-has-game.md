Took the kiddos to see "The Rock" in his new movie, *The Game Plan*. It
was fun! All the expected turns.

1. Surprise, you've got a kid. Shake up your life.
1. Oh man, hard to get used to a kid. I'm rich, famous, and a football
   player.
1. Bonding begins to occur. Starting to like your kid...
1. Oops, I shouted something mean to you. You get hurt, and OMG I'm an
   asshole.
1. Realization that your kid is important in your life sets in. Now you
   don't have her. Dummy.
1. You start to suck at your job. She shows up, and you stop sucking.
1. Tears ensue, everyone wins, and is happy.
1. The end.

I will say that I did have a good time. Plenty of funny little quips,
and the magic between The Rock and Madison Pettis is really good. It
gets my family movie "A".
