This last Saturday night Maryanne and I hosted a movie watching party.
We invited several people but ended up with most not able to show, or
unable to at the last minute due to shifts in priority and schedule.
Just the same it turned out well though.  

We had all the movie watching junk foods: M&Ms, chips, dips, candies,
cookies, **POPCORN**, and pizza. We also had halves of coconuts to bang
together during the movie, as well as tiny "Holy Hand Grenades" to toss
at the screen at the bunny scene.  
  
If you didn't make it, you shoulda!!
