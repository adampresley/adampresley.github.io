## Notice: This project no longer exists

Out of necessity I have created a little Windows application which will
scan and analyize a given set of text, and produce a character class set
for use in a regular expression.  
  
So, if you have the text I am 28 years old., it will produce
[a-z0-9\\s\\.]. It also allows you to specify which characters are
special and need escaping.  
  
Please note this tool requires .NET 2.0 to be installed on your
computer. Cheers! :D
