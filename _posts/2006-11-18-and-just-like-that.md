And just like that, NerdCon '06 is now officially over. All bags were
packed, and all visitors sent safely away back home. Buses, planes, and
sighs. Plenty of pictures to prove that they actually came in real life,
and that this whole thing wasn't just some kind of Jedi Academy server
mod. It wasn't.  
  
I won't go into me because me is boring, and depressing. The last post
should tell you that. I will go on and say that we had a good time here.
Plenty of IHOP, "O RLY" syrup container birds, video games, Guitar Hero
pwnage, and more. I will go on the record and state that I do look
forward to NerdCon '07. Early talks involve flying out to California and
nerding it up there. I'll see you all there.
