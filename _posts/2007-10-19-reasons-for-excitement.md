Two reasons for my excitement this morning, and I shall sum them up
promptly: Lord of the Rings Online content update, and Street Fighter
IV. That's right, you heard it. Street Fighter IV! I LOVED the old
Street Fighter games. I grew up playing those in the arcades all day
long, and then on my Super Nintendo. Pimp times.  
  
And to make it even better this month Turbine will be releasing their
next major content update, Bood 11, for Lord of the Rings Online. This
update features grand coolness like player and kinship housing, complete
with furnishings and vendor discounts, and even taxidermy. Also on the
docket are new quests, and a brand new 12 player raid instance in which
you face off with a Balroq! Rock on!  
  
Check out both of these at these links:
