Long under development, and not due to complexity, has my program
SyncXpress been. I am happy to state that it is nearly done with the
first beta. I've got most all the interface elements built. Package
management is working, allowing you to create, modify, and delete
packages and their respective targets. I finished writing and testing
the directory exclusion list editor last night, and it is working well.
I then began on the actual synchronization process, and once that part
is done, I'll be ready to put it up for download as a beta.
