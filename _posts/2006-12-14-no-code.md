Interesting. This makes two people who do not care for the blog entries
where there is code. I know some do not understand the code stuff, or
others just don't really care to read it.  
  
So should I stop blogging about the one thing I know most about? I mean
I only do one thing well, and that is code. I have very little life. I
go out on occasion, or whatever, but ... code. That is what I know how
to do. I have been told that my insights can be interesting. I disagree.
I simply word what everyone already knows in a way that sounds nice or
fancy. :p  
  
So, I suppose I'll focus on putting the code into separate pages.
