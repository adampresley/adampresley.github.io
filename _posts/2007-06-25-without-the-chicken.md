I just HAD to put it out there, this little ditty about a chicken
biscuit gone horribly wrong. One of the daily routines that Maryanne and
I have in our morning commute to work is to stop off at either
McDonald's or Chik-fil-A to get a bite to eat for breakfast.

I ordered my usual on this Thursday morning in the Chic-Fil-A
drive-thru: A number 1, add egg and cheese, with a large unsweet tea. We
picked up the order at the window and began to drive away, me pulling
out the contents of this bag o' goodies.

I hand Maryanne her breakfast burrito and then proceed to extract my
biscuit. To my great alarm and dismay, however, I discovered that my
chicken biscuit with egg and cheese was missing one critical element...
The chicken! RUINED!!! The day was RUINED!!
