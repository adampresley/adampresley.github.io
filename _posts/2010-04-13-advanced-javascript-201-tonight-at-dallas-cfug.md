Tonight I will be speaking at the Dallas/Ft. Worth ColdFusion User Group
meeting. I will be giving the introduction topic and will be covering
Advanced JavaScript 201. This includes topics on namespacing, closures,
and other "gotchas".   
  
The main topic, Iterator and Composite Patterns, will be presented by
Dave Shuck, continuing the Head First Design Patterns topics we've been
doing for a year now. So try to make it out, cause this is good stuff!
