Like to send out a thanks to Dave Shuck
(<http://daveshuck.instantspot.com/blog/>) for his presentation tonight
on the Strategy Pattern. Last month Dave suggested that each month
someone present on the next chapter in the Head First Design Patterns
book. However, since the book is geared toward Java developers, change
it up and give the presentation a ColdFusion flair. So this is what he
did.  
  
The coolest part consisted of dividing the group into two teams to draw
a basic model diagram of a particular business problem. From there he
introduced the Strategy pattern and demonstrated how to apply this to
our business problem. The interactive forum was particularly effective
in my opinion.  
  
So tune in next month as I will be presenting on the Observer Pattern,
and will quite possibly follow a similar format. Oh, and show up! Free
food is never a bad thing (hey, we had KFC baby)!  
  
Happy coding.
