Steve Bryant came up with the idea to, on August 1st, post a blog entry
on [How I Got Started in ColdFusion](http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day). So I will do just that.  
  
My story is much like many of yours. It starts with a boy who wanted to
be an astronaut (ok, so not all boys want to be astronauts), found a
computer, and became hooked by the idea that by telling it to do
something, in a certain way, it would simply do it.  
  
My "career" in software engineering started with a lowly TI-99 4a from
Texas Instruments. This machine featured 16K of RAM, a tape drive for
"recording" my programs, and a cartridge drive I rarely used. This was
later replaced by a Commodore 64, which was twice the machine! Using
code from books and magazines (no internet yet), at the age of 14, I was
learning to program. My friends called me a nerd because I learned how
to draw a stick-man on the screen, and made him move.  
  
It started on those computers with BASIC. On later, PC-based machines I
followed suit with QBASIC, then moving on to Pascal and C/C++. C++ I
liked a lot, while Pascal has remained "unfriended" for a long time. :)  
  
I was hooked, and knew that I wanted to do this all the time! After a
few years of "service" in tech support, MSN, Microsoft, Road Runner to
name a few, I finally got my break. A company in Dallas was looking for
a C++ programmer for internal applications. I applied for the job,
though having **no** real world experience, and somehow I landed the
job. I was in *way* over my head, but did manage to squeeze out a few
programs before I, and a few others, was laid off.  
  
A little later down the road I had found myself imaging old computers
for resale in a warehouse where I had to work with an old label printer.
For some odd reason it took two different programs, and a lot of steps
to work this old printer. So, being the good programmer I wanted to be,
I automated it in a little C++ application. My boss took notice of this
and told his Senior Programmer about it.  
  
At the time this Senior Programmer was building an e-commerce
application for them, and he needed some help. So he approched me asking
if I had ever done any programming in ColdFusion. I had never heard of
it, and had only dabbled in ASP-classic once before. I told the guy I'd
figure it out. So I went to work learning ColdFusion 6.0 MX.  
  
From there I've programming applications, both web and desktop, in many
languages, some favorites being PHP, Groovy, Java, and C#. But to this
day CFML and ColdFusion is the language that keeps me productive in both
my day job, and my side projects.
