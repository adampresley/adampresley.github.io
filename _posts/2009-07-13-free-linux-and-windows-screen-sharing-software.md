I'm a sucker for cool applications. I also am a super-sucker for
**FREE** cool applications. I was working on some code with my friend
Collin tonight and we had a need to take a look at some code together,
but we aren't anywhere near each other. To further complicate matters
I'm running on Ubuntu Linux and he on Windows. After a quick search I
came across [Yuuguu Instant Screen Sharing](http://www.yuuguu.com/home). What a neat program!  
  
A simple download of a Debian package, and moments later I get a sign-up
screen. That too was painless, and before I knew it, I simply entered my
MSN account information, I selected Collin from the list, and clicked
Share. Kaboom!!! Awesomeness exploded onto my screen, and we were
sharing desktops before I knew it! Go give it a go!
