If you happen to be one of us who do web-based application development
you may have at least heard the rumblings of Javascript 2, the successor
to the current Javascript implementation supported by major browsers,
and used more and more with the advent of the buzz word "Web 2.0" over
the last year. If you read any information on this Javascript 2 you
might have been a bit excited about some of the new features, especially
in language features, that were in the pipeline.

Here is an [interesting read](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Web-Leaders-Seek-JavaScript-Harmony/)
that talks about how the ECMA group, the
party responsible for drafting up the Javascript language standards, has
basically scrapped the current documents and talks of Javascript 2, and
started a new project name, Harmony.

It is a facinating read about how this standards committee has had to
scrap the current specs due to in-fighting, politics, and overall change
of direction. Sounds like my job!! :)
