**YES!** After a little more effort, and a bit more patience, we
**FINALLY**got our multiplayer brawl to start up for Super Smash
Brothers Brawl. Bout f'n time! I switched out between Yoshi and Marth,
Josh switched out between Link and Ike, and Tabitha played Zelda, Donky
Kong, and Kirby.  
  
I then saved three of our matches to my SD card. After we finished
playing I reviewed each match for screenshots. To do this, the game
allows you to pause your reply at any point, zoom, pan, and rotate for
the best angles, and save screen shots. The **BAD** thing about it is
that Nintendo, in their infinite wisdom, made it so that you can only
send them to another Brawl owner, or to an SD card. But even with the SD
card option they are BIN files, apparently raw image format. So I went a
hunting for a tool, and did find one called *bin2jpg* that will convert
the BIN files to JPG files suitable for posting.
