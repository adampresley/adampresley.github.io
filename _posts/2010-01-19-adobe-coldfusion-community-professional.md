While watching a movie on TV last night, *Daylight* specifically (yes,
the one with Sylvester Stallone), I received an email that had me as
excited as if I was going to see Metallica in concert. The subject:
**Welcome to the Adobe Community Professionals program 2010**.
Needless to say I stayed up **WAY** too late checking out all of the
new, cool stuff I have access to. In fact I could barely sleep, so I had
to stay up and play more video games just to get tired!  
  
I would like to thank all of the wonderful people who nominated me, and
believe that I have something useful to contribute to the ColdFusion
community (you know who you are). :) I will strive to continue being
nerdy and excited about ColdFusion development, and hope that I can give
some of that excitement to the community!  
  
Thank you all again, and happy coding!  
  
P.S. I'm bringin' nerdy back.
