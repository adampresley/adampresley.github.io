Just wanted to post a little blurb stating that I downloaded
Google Chrome last night. My first impressions are positive overall. As
I understand it the browser is built primarily off Webkit, a technology
that not only drive's the Mac OSX Safari browser, but several other Mac
OSX products. So far this has not proved to be any issue. In fact I have
found that many sites render **QUITE** faster than Firefox or IE.

Other neat features include the all-in-one URL bar, which doubles as a
search tool as well. Tabs are completely free form, and can be easily
re-arranged, or dragged to other windows, or as a new window. Tabs also
are independant threads of execution, so they've built their own "task
manager" which allows you to easily kill an offending, crashing tab.

Only time will tell if Google can make this a Grade A browser, and I
look forward to seeing them give it a shot!
