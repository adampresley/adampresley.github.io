In light of the recent proposed CISPA bill, HR 3523, I have written my
House Representative Ralph Hall the following letter. I encourage you to
do the same if you feel that this bill would be potentially detrimental
to online privacy.

> Dear Mr. Hall,
>
> I am writing you in regards to the proposed bill HR 3523, better known
> as CISPA, or the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. Having
> reviewed the wording of the proposed bill myself, as well as the
> abundant media coverage and analysis from dozens of other sources I
> write to express my concern over what I consider to be a dangerously
> broad and unspecific proposal of power to our federal government and
> the corporate private sector.
>
>  As a professional in the computer software industry I am well aware
> of the issues surrounding cyber security and understand how difficult
> it is to track, rectify and prevent criminal cyber attacks in software
> and network systems. As an "average Joe" I have had my personal web
> site attacked by foreign persons, family members who have lost money
> from identity theft, and gone through the pain of trying to "secure"
> software from perceived threats.
>
>  I do not, however, feel that such broad powers given by language as
> vague as "...theft or misappropriation of private or government
> information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable
> information" is the answer in a world greedy, patent
> portfolio-strengthening corporations, ever concerned about copyright
> infringement affecting the bottom line. I feel this type of response
> to cyber security issues is far too knee-jerk, and requires a great
> deal of analysis and consensus from more than just large corporate
> entities with an interest in protecting IP. I'm talking about some of
> the companies backing this bill, i.e. AT&T, Microsoft, Dell, Facebook,
> Verizon, Oracle, all of which recently have been involved in IP,
> copyright, or patent lawsuit.
>
>  I urge you and all members of the House to abandon this bill and
> instead find security experts who do not have a dollar attached to
> some IP lawsuit, but have the privacy and rights of the average
> netizen in mind. Thank you for your time.
>
> Sincerely,
> Adam Presley
