I'm happy to announce my second plugin is up on the jQuery website for
download, AP Text Counter. This is a simple plugin that implements a
text limiter and counter mechanism in jQuery, complete with customizable
options and useful callbacks to know when various events occur. Here are
the links, so go give it a try, and happy coding!  
  
Notice: This plugin is no longer supported. There are plenty of other, better character counting/limiting plugins available.
