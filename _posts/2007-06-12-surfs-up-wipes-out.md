That's right folks. Your's truly took the girlfriend and kiddos to see
the movie Surf's Up. Although touted as a funny movie, a great ride, I
found that Surf's Up wiped out. The film concept was creative in that
they filmed it similar to a documentary. Instead of being entertained I
found myself getting up halfway through the movie to buy a slurpie. Yes,
I was that bored. Ok, so it had a couple of funny moments, but not
enough to warrant a good score.
Overall, I give it a C-.
