It's funny the little things you miss as you use a programming language.
Although not considered the **longest**amount of time, I *have* been
using ColdFusion for over 4 years now. I've worked with CFC's,
frameworks, performance tuning, reflection, advanced Java techniques,
and more, but somehow seemed to missed one of the most simple, yet
useful little attributes (at least useful to me now).  
  
Very frequently I find myself dumping out debug data to evaluate how the
results of a given set of code is coming along. Good old <CFDUMP> is
my friend in plenty of cases. How in the world, then, did I miss the
**expand="no"** attribute? OMG! Whenever I'm dumping out large CFC
structures, that puppy is my FRIEND! lol.  
  
This, in my opinion, is one of the beauties of programming. Always
learning something new.
