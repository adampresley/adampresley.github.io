As some of you may know I wrote and maintain a plugin for the popular
and excellent [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) text editor
called [View In Browser](http://adampresley.github.io/sublime-view-in-browser/).
To date this is my most popular plugin with 10 forks and 30 stars. Not
much compared to some but I am proud that a few folks have found it
useful.

So here is a quick blog blurb to say that I've created a wiki for this
plugin. This wiki covers installation, how to configure the plugin to
user your favorite browser and answers common questions on how to get it
to use your local server environment. Also the home page has a facelift
and is no longer just an HTML copy of the README. Just a little nicer,
or at least I think so. :)
