I took my baby girls to the movie *Meet the Robinsons*. They enjoyed it,
even though my seven year old appears to be scared of all things 3D,
which is the version we went to see. There are two versions. The regular
3D animated version, and the TrueD 3D jump-at-ya version. Allow me to
state that the TrueD version was quite impressive. Very nice 3D effect.  
  
Overall the movie was quite predictable, from start to finish. I will
say that it was enjoyable, however, and quite cute, peppered with a few
funny moments to keep the kids interested. I give it a B-. :)
