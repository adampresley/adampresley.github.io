I am happy to announce I have released CFBarbecue version 1.0 on
RIAForge! CFBarbecue is a ColdFusion wrapper for the Barbecue Barcode
Java library, and provides the ability to generate and display barcodes
on your web application pages. It also makes scaling and rotating
barcodes easy too.  
  
Visit the [RIAForge page](http://cfbarbecue.riaforge.org/) to download 
the library. Happy coding!
