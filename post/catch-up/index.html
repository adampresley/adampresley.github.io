            <p>Been a while since I last posted, so I&rsquo;ll use this time to just play a
little catch-up. Over the last couple of weeks work has been the most
occupying event.</p>

<p>Last Saturday Maryanne, Tabitha, and I went to our friend and coworker
Katie&rsquo;s house. We arrived just before everyone else and got the grand
tour of Katie&rsquo;s beautiful house, as well as an idea of just how crazy
she is in regard to the Toy Story alien collection obsession.</p>

<p>We had a great time with the fun and games. I brought Guitar Hero I and
II with me for additional entertainment. Katie also had Karaoke
Revolution. At first most wouldn&rsquo;t play&hellip; in fact I didn&rsquo;t know they
were going to till I came upstairs and I was handed a microphone in the
middle of a song and told &ldquo;Sing!&rdquo;. Ok, so I did. After that, just about
everyone gave it a go. Now, you might think that this would not be fun,
but interestingly enough it is quite addicting; addicting enough for me
to go out and buy one myself the next day! After the games we went on to
the main attraction: Rocky Horror Picture Show. With Katie doing the
audience prompts, everyone singing the songs, and Tim and I doing the
Time Warp, it turned out to be a great success.</p>

<p>Sunday we took my girls out to lunch at Applebee&rsquo;s. It was interesting
because I told Aaliyah that she couldn&rsquo;t have fries with her chicken
strips, and that she should try apple sauce as it is a little better for
you. She actually started crying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t WANT applesauce&rdquo;. But, in the
end, I am the parent, and won that argument. And guess what? She likes
the applesauce. :)</p>

<p>We then took them school supply shopping. Taylor is starting the 2nd
grade and needs a horde of supplies. Poor Aaliyah wanted to buy supplies
too, but since Shannon wasn&rsquo;t sure if she&rsquo;d get into pre-K this year we
decided to hold off on that. So now Taylor is all school supplied up,
including a much non-needed girly backpack and lunch box.</p>

<p>In other news I watched a couple of movies these last two weeks. Went to
the theater and saw <strong>Transformers</strong>. One word to describe it all:
<strong>Awesome!</strong> That has to be the most fun I&rsquo;ve had a movie in a long
while. Funny, action packed, with plenty of throwbacks to the original
cartoons. Rock and roll!</p>

<p>Also saw <strong>300</strong> finally. I have to say that I did like it. Very
stylistic in the artistry, especially in the computer enhanced scenery.
They spent a bit too much time trying to introduce you to, or explain as
the case may be, the Spartan mentality of culture, strength, and
weakness. But overall, a pretty good action flick.</p>

<p>To top it all off Maryanne and I have started on the Weight Watchers
program last week. Today actually makes my first week, and I weigh in
tonight to see if there is any progress. The meeting is also tonight. I
find the meetings to be very &ldquo;RA RA!&rdquo;, but they offer good support and
accountability, which I certainly need seeing that I have not NEARLY
enough self control when it comes to food. So I remain hopeful and
fairly confident that I can do this, especially with Maryanne at my
side. :)</p>
