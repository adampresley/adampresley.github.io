Hi, my name is Adam Presley. I am a father, husband, and software engineer with over 15 years experience. This blog is where I catalog my adventures in coding and architectural design. From time to time I'll even attempt to stretch my *soft skills* a bit by dealing with more people-focused and intellectual topics.

I have a wide array of experiences in various software languages, tech stacks, and business fields. I have worked in healthcare, e-commerce, inventory and warehouse management systems, real-estate, and more. I have written software in many languages, though I am most versed in [Go](http://golang.org), [ColdFusion](http://lucee.org/), [PHP](https://secure.php.net/), and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx). I also do work with Mobile technologies using hybrid-HTML5 on Android and iOS.

I am available for contract work and enjoy speaking to user groups, engineering teams, and the rare conference from time to time. Please feel free to contact me via email at adam@adampresley.com.
