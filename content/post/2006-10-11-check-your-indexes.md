Yesterday, although certainly not the worst, did not start out too well.
I'm sitting at my desk, coding away, when at around 9:30 I get an alert
from our tech support persons that we have servers that aren't
responding. I jump on the phone with our hosting provider only to
discover that my supervisor had already called them, but he had only
instructed them to reboot ColdFusion one of our servers. When tech
support came to me, NONE of our seven web servers were responding. I
inform the hosting company of this so they can address the issue
immediately. Tuesday... downtime... bad, for that is typically payroll
day for our customers. Yipes! Server shutdown hell!
