Went to the movies for the first time in a while. Tabitha and I went and
saw Eragon. First allow me to state that I've never read the book(s), so
I had no particular expectations going into this.

Overall the movie was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but
really nice special effects, and when the action finally really kicked
in, good action sequences. I like some of the fantasy concepts put into
place here, so I suspect that the books are probably pretty good. I
think I shall get them.
