I downloaded the demo for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed today on my
PS3. I am pretty big fan of Star Wars in general, and I have awaited
this particular release for a long time now. Yes, I've already
pre-purchased the game, but I went ahead and downloaded the demo just to
get a taste. Short version, awesome. You start out with a pretty
impressive array of Force powers and lightsaber skills, and fairly
quickly you begin to improve your skills and level up. Graphics look
great, of course, on my high-def TV. Overall I am quite excited.
