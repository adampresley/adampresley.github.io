Yes, I know. I seem to have a hard time sticking to one theme. It's just
what I do. More importantly, however, I'd like to announce that I am on
the latest, greatest, WordPress 2.5!

I'm not going to say too much, because you should probably check it out
for yourselves, but I'm diggin' it. The new administrative interface is
way nicer than the older one, IMHO. I've heard some grumblings on the
internet about some folks not liking it. I suspect these people fear
change in the first place, ergo the grumbling. Sporting a tighter
interface, new media management features, and better security, I'm
sold.

Give it a look at <http://wordpress.org/> and get yours today!
