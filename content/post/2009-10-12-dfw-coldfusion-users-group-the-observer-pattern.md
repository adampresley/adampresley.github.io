Tomorrow evening on October 13th, 2009 I will be presenting to the
Dallas/Ft. Worth ColdFusion Users Group the second part of the Head
First Design Patterns for CF, otherwise known as the Observer Pattern.
There we not only be my presentation, but Luis Majano (creator of
ColdBox) will be presenting remotely ON ColdBox. Not to mention pizza
and additional nerdiness.

So come one, and come all. For more information visit

See ya there!
