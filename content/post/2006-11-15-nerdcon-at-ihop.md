So here we are at IHOP. Nolan is making fun of people who are emo and
blog at IHOP... Strange, cause that is what I am doing. <_< They
can't talk as they are all talking MySpace picture poses. Nerds.

This is somewhere around the third or fourth time for us to come to
IHOP. We **LOVE** pancakes! And can you blame us? Fluffy, syrupy
goodness coating your mouth in maple glory! And can you beat the
neverending cups of coffee?

I think not! Today is Nolan's last day here, so we just got done
bowling. Nolan pwnt for the upset, followed closely by Tabitha. After
the complete bowling embarrassment we went and played video games. What
a shock... <_< Dance Dance, air hockey, shoot 'em up games, etc...

We've had a blast. Yet this whole time I find myself going to sleep and
wishing one person was here. *sigh*

Nolan: Mood, apathetic. Life is overrated. *stabby rip stab stab*

Adam: *sigh* Journal, sometimes I think you're the only one who
understands me. :p
