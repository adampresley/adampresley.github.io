What am I to do? I'm not always depressed and sad. But sometimes I can't
shake the feeling that this, the me my friends and coworkers have come
to know and expect is all I'll ever be. That isn't too much. I'm
generally the light hearted, obnoxious, lovable nerd. But that's it. The
lovable nerd.

What more do I expect? Not 100% sure, but I can say that it can be hard
to imagine that this is what I will be, and who everyone I know will
expect me to be, for the next 40 years. No one wants to be mediocre.
Everyone wants to be a bit more. To be special to someone or more than
someone. To be remembered for something more than just the lovable nerd.
