I have no words. I have no wisdom. I have no success. I have no dream.
The mind can be a horrible place, and memories visions of torture, and
hopes false light never given life outside the dark. For light cannot
illuminate that which has no vision, no place of origin, no destination.
For where can light go when there is nowhere to be found?

And that is true torture. Nowhere. Nothing. To never succeed in that
which matters most to a mind. To never taste that which a soul craves
more than light. To always hunger and have not food to satisfy, and no
stomach for food that could satisfy. And when the mind despairs what
then is left? For when the will is gone and the mind finds no solace
there is naught but emptiness.

This is the burning hell that shreds the souls of those who suffer
emptiness in this world. To dream and have only black. To wish and
receive nothing. To hope and find only emptiness. To try only to fail
and fall.
