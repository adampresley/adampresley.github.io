Flowers open bright and bold
Dreams and visions flicker, fade
Kiss me now venom sweet
And call me bitter, sour, old

Alone with the wind
Thoughts to scatter across the city
A million faces concealed from view
How far can a tree bend?

Like coffee without cream
Black like darkness without hope for light
A glimmer of peace from ages past
A dream of a dream

Reaching high for her hand
Perched upon that pedestal
Precariously sketched on pages in my mind
Take me now to distant land

So the butterfly dreams
To fly so far away
Will it find home here
Among the bitter things?
