I am pleased to report that MailSlurper now has documentation! Visit the [MailSlurper Wiki Page](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper/wiki) to learn how to get started using MailSlurper. Here you will also find more information about the user interface, saved searches, user settings, how to configure a SQL server, and more.

Cheers, and happy slurping!
