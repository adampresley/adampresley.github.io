Today Maryanne, the kids and I joined the whole family gang at the
[Dallas World Aquarium](http://www.dwazoo.com/default.html) for some fishy fun. Although fairly cool
outside the sun was shining and it turned out to be a nice day for an
outing. The Dallas Aquarium is a decent enough exhibit, featuring plenty
of fish, as well as bugs, birds, alligators, and more.The kids enjoyed
themselves at the many wonderous sights to behold. My biggest complaint
about this aquarium is the fact that it is far too confusing.With too
many twists and turns it is hard to remember where you have been, let
alone know where to go next.

After that we headed over to [Bebe's Chicken](http://www.babeschicken.com/), one of my favourite
places to eat. Some of the tastiest chicken around!
