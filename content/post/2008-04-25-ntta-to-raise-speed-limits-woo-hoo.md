Today I learned that the North Texas Toll Authority, affectionately
known as NTTA, has requested that the speed limits be raised by 10 miles
per hour on our major toll road areas, including the North Dallas
Tollway and the President George Bush Tollway. It appears that the NTTA
has not raised the speed limits, which currently stand between 55 and 60
MPH, because of a failure to conduct the state's required speed safety
tests, prohibiting the much desired raise in limit.

I for one am quite happy to hear this news. It pains me to know that I
could get a ticket for going over **55 freakin miles per hour** on a
road that ***I HAVE TO PAY TO DRIVE ON!!!*** Good grief, and about time.
