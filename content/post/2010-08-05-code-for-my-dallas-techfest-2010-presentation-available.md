Finally, as requested, my code and slides for my Dallas TechFest 2010
presentation are available for download. If you missed it I presented on
taking an existing ColdFusion application (could be anything, PHP, JSP,
Groovy + Grails) and incrementally spicing it up with [jQuery](http://jquery.com). Click
[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5726689/blog-downloads/MovieMania.zip) to download the code!
