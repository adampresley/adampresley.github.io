Well, by tomorrow I will have had [Bell's Palsy](http://www.webmd.com/brain/tc/bells-palsy-topic-overview)
for one week. Let me say that it is a very strange experience. For those who do not know
Bell's Palsy is allow me to indulge. Bell's Palsy is a condition that
causes temporary paralysis on one side of your face. This condition
bascially prohibits the movement of your facial muscles on one side. In
other words, you cannot blink correctly, you cannot talk or chew on that
side of your face, and you cannot smile on the affected side either.

This condition happens due to some type of damage or inflammation to a
nerve that controls all facial movement on that side of your face. This
damage can apparently be caused by one of several possible factors,
including the herpes simplex virus (cold sore virus), chicken
pox/shingles virus, or even possibly stress, or so I've read.

So as a result I am on an anti-viral medication, as well as a steriod to
keep permanent damage to this nerve to a minimum. Some of these drugs,
however, can cause sleeplessness, which is kinda starting to suck
because normally I can sleep at will, but not lately.

I'm also a little self conscious about how I am talking, though not so
much on how it looks. At my job I am the Lead Software Architect, which
is basically a big fancy title for being nerdier than the other software
engineers. It also means that I spend a lot of time **TALKING** with
engineers, in design meetings, and more. With this Bell's Palsy it is
tiring to talk a lot, as the more I do it, the more tired my face
becomes from trying to move my mouth. I suppose I'm a little afraid of
not being taken seriously when my speech is slurring a little bit every
now and again. It's somthing I'm working on though.

So there's my story.
