For those of us that play video games, raise your hand if you remember
playing Diablo and Diablo II. Yeah, me too. What **AWESOME** games! The
action + rpg elemnts made it a fantastical addiction that kept many a
gamer up well past their bed time.

Well, I'm not sure how I missed this game a year ago, but Titan Quest is
**JUST** like it! Same ISO view, same controls, same game elements. I'm
finding it quite entertaining. The graphics are pretty good, and the
gameplay is as good as ever. I've encountered a couple of bugs in
multiplayer, such as the other player simply appearing stuck on your
screen, yet they are moving on theirs.

If you got $20 extra bucks give it a go, and relive the old Diablo
days!
