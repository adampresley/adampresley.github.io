According the the website [www.cffringe.org](http://www.cffringe.org) :

> CFFringe is the only CFML conference focused exclusively on open
> source and fringe topics in CFML.
>
> If you're interested in getting into the open source CFML engines,
> enhancing CFML engines through plugins or outright hacking, and
> socializing with people doing cutting-edge things with CFML, this is the
> place for you.

I encourage everyone to go to their website and register to stay tuned
to what I think is a great idea for a conference!
