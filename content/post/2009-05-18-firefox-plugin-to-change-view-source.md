Here's a nifty plugin written Davide Ficano that allows you to control
what application(s) that is used to view the HTML source on a given page
in Firefox. I use a nice text editor called [Boxer](http://www.boxersoftware.com/) that I prefer over
the default, and this plugin allows me to use it. Web developers should
give it a [download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/394).
