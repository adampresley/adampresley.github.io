Ok, why am I having the hardest time with code syntax highlighting in
WordPress? I've downloaded a few plugins, tried em out, but everyone of
the so far suffers from WordPress stripping any code, well, at least
ColdFusion code, out of the editor. Very frustrating. If anyone finds a
good one, that can stop the stupid stripping, that would be great.
