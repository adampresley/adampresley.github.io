MailSlurper 4.0 has just been released. This update addresses some bugs in parsing attachments and date display. It also adds the ability to choose from one of the following storage engines:

* SQlite
* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server

This enhancement is one of several planned to make MailSlurper not only useful to individuals developing locally, but also to development teams in shared environments. So go grab the [latest from Github](https://github.com/adampresley/mailslurper-go/releases/tag/4.0)!
