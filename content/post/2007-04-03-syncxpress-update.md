Ladies and Gentlemen! I have put up for public download the first alpha
release of SyncXpress. It is still in VERY early production, and not
ready for prime time, so use at your own risk. You will need .NET 2.0 to
run this application. I also hope to have a forum up soon for feedback
and chat regarding features and bugs and such.
