Yesterday the family and I went out to Grapevine to see the Gaylord
Texan ICE! exhibit. With over 2 million pounds of ice in a 14,000 square
foot compound ICE was a very cool (literally and figuratively)
experience. Large parkas were provided to ward off the 9 degree
temperatures at this winter wonderland, but despite the chilly
atmosphere and fairly steep price, it was well worth the trouble and the
money. A very beautiful exhibit, and a fun time had by all.
