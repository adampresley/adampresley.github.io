A quick post to announce my new JavaScript component,
**apMessageBox**. This component is a quick and easy way to display
error or informational messages in JavaScript-based applications. It is
based jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI 1.8. [Go here](https://github.com/adampresley/apMessageBox) to see more about it!
