I work for a company that provides eCommerce applications for NFL and
NCAA teams. Two days ago we released the new web application for the
Houston Texans team. Written in ColdFusion 8, and powered by jQuery, the
new application boasts a sleeker new design and makes use of some of the
newest Web 2.0 goodness. Make sure to check it out at

Update 2013-07-29: Sadly this site is no longer in operation. The aforementioned company is no longer in business.
