So my girlfriend and I were discussing some plans we've gotta make this
year, and started talking about cool dates. You know, like 9/9/1999. The
coolest one so far for this year would be 10/10/2010 (ten ten ten).

So anyone who has ever known me knows that not only am I a giant nerd,
but I own it. I immediately recognized that 10/10/10 could be
represented in binary as 101010. And then I busted out a calculator
because I suck at converting binary to decimal. And guess what???

**101010 = 42!!!!** The answer to the ultimate question of life, the
universe, and everything!! How super cool is that?
