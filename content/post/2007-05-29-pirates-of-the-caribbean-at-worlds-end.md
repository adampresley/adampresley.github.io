**WARNING: Some Spoilers in here. Do not read if you don't want to hear
about the movie before seeing.**

Ok, disclaimer out of the way, let's talk pirates. The family,
girlfriend, and I went to see the latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean
franchise. Initial response? I like it. I'd give it a B+ overall. Yes, I
feel some of the magic is diminished, but this movie still has some
charm. All the old favorite characters are present to put their own
particular flavor into the movie mix, much like the last two.

This movie continues from the second one where the East India Trading
Company is slated to take over the seas, and thus the world through the
possession of Davey Jones's heart, and therefore the power he possess.
And it would seem they are well on their way. Apparently there is a
group of pirates that make up the Pirate Lords, and meet only on the
gravest of occasions to settle matters that are of importance to them.
This is one of those occasions. The idea? Release Calipso, the sea
goddess, from her human prison (yes, you met her in Pirates II) and back
into production, in hopes that she will aide the pirates against the
crusading Lord Beckett.

The biggest plot hole that I can see is this. How is Barbosa a pirate
lord at the same time that Jack is a pirate lord? In the first movie,
Barbosa was Jack's first mate, and then Barbosa mutinied against Jack,
leaving Jack NOT a captain for about 8 years. If Jack was already a
pirate lord because he was the captain of the Black Pearl, how then did
Barbosa become one? Somewhere in between? If so, why did Jack keep his?
Yes, it feels a bit loose.

Anywho, a good flick, fun, and of course, make sure to stick around
AFTER the credits.
