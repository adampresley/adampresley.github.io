This year Shakespeare Festival of Dallas held their annual show at the
usual location in Samual Grand Park, but also at Addison Circle Park. So
I attended the Addison show. What started out to be a cool, brisk
evening turned out to be a blustery, windy event that chilled the
bones.

Aside from the weather the show was actually pretty good. I must say I
enjoyed it. The only items that I feel were a little off where the speed
of some delivery of the lines and couplets. A lot of it felt WAY too
rushed. I will note, however, that the set this year was very nice!

Overall, good work!
