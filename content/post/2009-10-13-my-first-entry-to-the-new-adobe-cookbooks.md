I have posted my first entry to Adobe's new Cookbook today. It is a
revisit of my blog entry on creating a more user-friendly psudo-random
keys without having to use a UUID ([coldfusion-random-id-generation](|filename|/coldfusion-random-id-generation.md)).
Take a look, and give a vote!

Happy coding!
