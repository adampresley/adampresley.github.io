Today myself and a group from work went to the [Flying Fish](http://www.yelp.com/biz/flying-fish-dallas-2)
resturaunt here in Addison. We've been there many times before as its a
pretty good cajun-style fish joint. This time I decided I was hungry,
and wanted more than just a filet or two of catfish. Lo and behold on
the menu I see "Catfish Baskey - Whole catfish". Sounds like a lot of
catfish, so I order it! Not to mention they happen to have glass bottled
Coca-Cola, which I'm a fan of.

Happily I seat myself in a booth with my Cokes in hand, armed with a
buzzer for this fine establishment to summon me when my food is ready.
Eagerly I await it. Buzzz!! "Sweet".

I go to get my food, and have to pause in front of the basket of fish
and fries. Apparently when they say "Whole catfish" they mean WHOLE
catfish. Literally they battered a WHOLE catfish, head to tail, and deep
fry his ass. I can't say the experience was bad, because it tasted
really good. It's just that it takes some getting used to accidentally
biting into the spine, and having to pull it out of your mouth to get to
the fish meat. Been a long time since I've had the fish with bone in it.
