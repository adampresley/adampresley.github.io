Today Maryanne and I went for another round of wedding ring shopping. I
am pleased to announce that we have made our final decision and rings
have been purchased for both her and myself. We ended up making our
purchase at Zales from the manager Chris. It was actually a really great
experience working with him to pick out our rings. So many of the
previous sales people were... well... too "salesy". I know that they are
**supposed** to make the sale, but I honestly don't need to
continually hear about "great value" and "superior service" and
"fantastic warranty". Most **all** jewelry providers offer some type
of warranty, and most all are interested in providing a good service, as
most all of them want my money!

Chris at Zales was friendly, easy to talk to, and was quick to point out
the sales, specials, and not try to shove the $24,000 rings on
Maryanne's fingers. If you would like to see a picture of her ring and
Maryanne's account of the shopping experience you can visit our wedding

Oh, and yay! Another wedding checklist item marked off the list! Woo
hoo!
