I have just published a small but important update to MailSlurper. Previously mails with attachments would cause issues with the parser and would not display correctly in the administrator. This has been addressed. In fact you can now see that a mail has attachments and even view them! So go get the latest [version 3.5 on Github](https://github.com/adampresley/mailslurper-go/releases/tag/3.5). Happy coding!
