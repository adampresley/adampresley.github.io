So my brother, his friend, and I tried to all hook up and have a nice
Super Smash Brothers Brawl beat-em up session on our Wii's tonight.
Didn't happen. Instead we spent over an hour trying to connect to each
other's hosted games, letting each churn for over 10 minutes each, every
time either timing out, or just never connecting.

It would seem that Nintendo was ill prepared for this kind of response.
I find this amusing due to the fact that this game was highly
anticipated for **MONTHS** now, and you would think that with a game
this popular Nintendo would have beefed up the backend servers, ready to
take on the masses of rabit brawlers ready to do battle! Instead they
played conservative for their first *serious* online venture, and I must
say that they are starting to disappoint. No connection tonight, laggy
connection last night... All in all it is not looking like a good PR
campaign for the top selling video game giant right now.
