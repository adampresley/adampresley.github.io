NOOOO!!! Microsoft is an evil empire which represents all that is base
in the corporate world! Why? I dunno... I just wanted to sound like
everyone else. But I digress... Microsoft and Zend Technologies, Inc.
have "partnered" together to make PHP better for the Windows platform.
Why? Because according to Zend the majority of PHP applications are
running on the Windows platform, even though we all know PHP has
historically run better on the Linux platform.

And why would I be concerned about this? Microsoft has a **LONG** and
prestigious career in stealing/purchasing other people's software. I
might have to jump off a bridge (a short one... don't wanna die) if
Microsoft takes over PHP.
