Today Adobe has announced the release of its official IDE for ColdFusion
rapid-application development, [ColdFusion Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/).
As a user of the beta versions for quite some time now I can go on the record and
say that ColdFusion Builder is a welcome product. Important features (in
my head anyway) include:

* Syntax highlighting (in both tags **AND** script)
* Code insight
* XML, CSS, and JavaScript highlighting support
* Code folding
* FTP/sFTP support
* Complete language support, including ColdFusion 9's ORM features
* Ability to connect/control ColdFusion servers and services
* Monitor log files with TailView
* Code outline view for quick document traversal
* Plug-ins for component code generation
* Built-in SQL editor (connect to datasources and craft SQL real-time)

The list goes on and on proving that Adobe has really put a lot of
effort into the product. And right now Adobe is offering ColdFusion
Builder **AND** Flash Builder 4 Standard for only $299. That's
actually a heck of a deal! Here are a few more resources and such to add
to the hype.
