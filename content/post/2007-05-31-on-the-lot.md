Perhaps a few of you have heard of that new reality show called *On the
Lot*? Well, even if you haven't, I suggest checking it out. If you are a
movie goer such as myself you might enjoy this. The premise is simple.
Take unknown, unheard of aspiring directors, give them challenges and
have them compete to win a $1 million dollar contract with DreamWorks
(tm).

Yup, that's right. And the challenges are pretty cool. So far they have
had challenges where they have to work together, work against each
other, or make short movies that convey some type of thought, or in a
particular genre. So far, this show has promise. Let us see where it
goes.
