A super quick update: I have updated MailSlurper's administrative
interface to now have paging and column sorting!! And in Grails this was
super easy to do. I totally need to blog about this later. Meanwhile
check it out and go [download it](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5726689/blog-downloads/MailSlurper.zip).
Cheers!!
