Quite an eventful weekend for Maryanne and I. Friday night we went out
to Sonny Bryan's in downtown Dallas for Billy's rehearsal dinner, and at
the same time to surprise Maryanne's good friends Dana and John. We had
a smashing good time and stuffed ourselves completely with good BBQ. We
went home that night.

Saturday we packed up for the wedding at the Pegasus Room and our
subsequent stay at Hotel Magnolia. It was a nice room and hotel. The
Pegasus Room is apparently the old Dallas Power and Light building, and
had some really cool old architecture. I suppose the wedding was
beautiful, and I only suppose because we couldn't see a thing. The room
was far too small, and we were seated on the side of the room. Basically
I could see the bride's head. That's it. :(

After the wedding there was a short hour for drinks back at the hotel,
then it was back to the Pegasus Room for the reception. It was a proper
party with a DJ, buffet, open bar, and the whole nine yards. A good
number of Jim Bean and cokes later it was time to head back to our
room.

The next morning we greeted the other guests for breakfast in a private
room with the newlyweds all a-glow. We then spent a good amount of time
carting Dana, John and family around, helping pack, unpack, and so on.
After lunch we all lounged around the pool for a while, then time for
home.

Meanwhile took some time to attempt to recreate some code Ben Nadel had
posted in ColdFusion for searching structures using a regular
expression, but in Java instead of CF. This was a fun exercise, except
that my blog's code formatted looked crappy, so I spent several hours
getting a new formatter, and adjusting EVERY code blog entry. What a
pain. But in the end well worth it.
