Tonight Maryanne and I went to a lovely restaurant that just opened here
in Allen called **Brio Tuscan Grille**. We were greeted by very nice
valet parking attendants who even opened the door for us. Nice. A good start.

The atmosphere was a nice, low light Tuscany style, large dining room
with plenty of room for small and large parties alike. From greeting to
seating every one of the staff was nicely attired and very friendly.

Within a couple of minutes our waiter introduced himself and presented
us with the current specials and wine selections. Much to my delight not
only was he very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, anytime the
waiter was unable to come by another of the wait staff came by instead
to make sure we were taken care of.

The food was very tasty, and presentation was top
notch. Price vs. portion was not too bad for my entree, which was the
Roasted Lamb. Maryanne's dish, some type of seafood pasta, which was
also tasty, was only a little pricey for the portion.

We then decided to give the dessert a try. We had a wonderful,
melt-in-your-mouth brownie with ice cream dessert that was worth every
penny. Couple that with a good, mild coffee with cream and our dinner
was given a nice finish.

I enjoyed my experience at Brio, and look forward to returning there to
dine. For more information about this restaurant visit their website at
