For all you jQuery fans out there, take a look at my first plugin! This
plugin is a tagging component, similar to what is used to tag blog
entries, for example. I had a good time making it, and found jQuery
plugin development rather easy and fun.

Notice: This plugin is no longer supported. There are plenty of other, far better tag plugins out there.
