So, does everyone else have their holiday shopping done? Me? Negative. I
am close, though. I've got my girls a couple of gifts, mom and dad
almost covered. I now just have to get the grandparents, a few friend
gifts, and a few more gifts for my kiddos, cause it's all for them
anyway.

I don't know about you guys, but I love buying gifts for other people. I
love to see when they like what I got them, cause I enjoy trying to find
that right gift, if possible. It makes me feel good that I have the
success and means to buy these things for the people I care about. Feels
nice. :)

For the last couple of years, however, this feeling
has been difficult to achieve. You see, my sorry ass got married on
Christmas day over 8 years ago. After splitting with my ex-wife two
holidays have been real icky for me: Father's Day, and Chirstmas day.
See, married on Christmas day, then she kicks me out on Father's day.
Ouch.

Over two years have passed now, and I can honestly say that the pain
does lessen, but the mark is permanent. I'm pretty confident that the
scar never really goes away. Much like an old injury it aches when these
times come. But as time **has** gone by the pain lessens a bit more each
year.

So this year I'm hoping to find just a **wee** bit more joy than the
last, and I hope this trend continues. :)
