Last week we also celebrated Taylor's 8th birthday down here in the
neighborhood park. It was a beautiful day, but **SUPER WINDY!!** We had
to tape everything down with 6-pounds of tape! Grandma and Grandpa
showed up, as well as my folks and siblings. Niece Laura made it too.
She's getting too old, way too fast. :)
