I am happy to announce the release of **placefinder-py**, a Python
module for consuming the Yahoo! BOSS PlaceFinder geocoding services.
**placefinder-py** helps developers looking to add location geocoding to
their applications and web sites easier to do by simplifying REST calls
and OAuth authentication.

Geocoding is the task of taking street address, points of interest,
airports, or even place names, parsing them, and returning additional
information about them. This is most used to retrieve latitude and
longitude information about addresses.

For more information on the geocoding services offered by Yahoo! see
