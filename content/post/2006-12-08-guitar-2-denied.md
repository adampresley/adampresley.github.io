I went to Fry's Electronics tonight in search of a second guitar for my
Guitar Hero 2 game. This is prompted by the fact that I was under the
impression that my current second guitar was broken. Notice I said
"impression". Turns out a lot of the third party guitars simply do not
work with Guitar Hero 2! And Fry's has them up **EVERYWHERE** while
promoting Guitar Hero 2. How do I know they don't work? I actually took
the guitar out of the box, plugged it in to their display, and tested
it. Same behavior as mine, the green button doesn't work.

And go figure, they don't sell **JUST** the first party guitar. <_<
BAH!
