Yes, it is true. NerdCon is nearly here. There are many folks arriving
from out of state to come and participate in what we do best. Being
nerds. I've been scrambling to make sure I've got every arrival, every
flight number, ever phone number organized on a calendar. I find myself
bummed that not everyone who was going to come isn't coming. We have a
couple who were going to make it but now cannot. I have had a great
plethora of emotions surrounding this. I've gone from indifferent, to
angry, to sad, back to indifferent. Truth is, however, I have no right
to be angry. Whatever circumstances that have arisen in their lives is
certainly well beyond my control, and in many instances beyond their
control. Yes, one of these people in particular I had really hoped could
make it. I had told myself this whole time not to get too excited, cause
these kinds of plans can fall through pretty easily. Hard to coordinate
and all. Despite that, I was **VERY** hopeful that she would make it.
Sadly, this is not so. More sad is her circumstance. Jen, I am very
sorry for all that you are going through, and I hope that you will be
able to take care of those that you call family; the people that matter
the most is family.

Of course, I've never been much of a planner. I've determined that
Tabitha is always the planner, but her plans always break for some
reason, or something breaks them. I have never really planned too much
of anything in my life, so starting now means I'm quite likely to screw
it up.

What's on the itinerary? Well, we've got dinner planned at Maggiano's at
least one night. Guitar jamming on another day. My little sister's
school play on yet another. Overall, we'll probably play a lot of video
games, but we'll have a good time.
