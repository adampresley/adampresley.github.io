Yes, it has happened again. I am trying yet another blogging software.
This time around: WordPress. I must say that I am far more impressed
with this software when compared to any of the previous ones I have
tried. This one offers a very nice, clean administration interface,
plenty of options, and lots of themes and plugins to boot. So far,
impressed.

Of course I'm spending this time on blogging software when I have other
things to do. I need to continue defining my data import language, and I
need to finish Chapter XII of the Assassin Saga, which I am slated to
write. Chapter X was just released, and Joe is writing Chapter XI, so I
don't have a lot of time. I need to get writing.

The outline is already done since this part of the storyline is already
thought out, so it won't be quite as hard as when I
wrote Chapter VIII, from scratch.

What is this I'm talking about? For those who don't know I am a member
and one of the leaders of an online gaming community that primarily
plays a game called Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Our group, or clan, is
called The League of Assassins (LOA). Several members, including myself,
are contributing to a series of fictional stories centered around our
clan, based in the Star Wars universe. I feel the stories are actually
quite good, and make for entertaining fictional reading. If you are
interested in having a look visit [The League of Assassins Resources
page](http://www.theleagueofassassins.com/resources.php) and
download the individual stories. My character's name is
Ahriman Vykos a.k.a. OneRing. Give em a read. They are good.
