Earlier this year I wrote a guest post for the web site [sublimetexttips.com](sublimetexttips.com). This post walks you through your first time writing a plugin for Sublime Text, the most superb text and code editor. Sublime plugins are written in Python. If you've never written any Python before don't let it stop you. Python is an easy language to get into and you will find the experience most rewarding. So if you've ever considered writing your own plugin for Sublime Text read my article over at [http://sublimetexttips.com/sublime-plugins-101-how-to-write-your-own-html5-template-plugin/](http://sublimetexttips.com/sublime-plugins-101-how-to-write-your-own-html5-template-plugin/). Cheers, and happy coding!
